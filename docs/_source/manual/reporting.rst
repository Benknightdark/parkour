Parkour provides reporting functions in two different formats. A quality report, summarizing the quality matrices of received samples, library construction details as well as details on cluster generation and sequencing. Second, templates from the  ENA (European Nucleotide Archive)  regarding your study, experiment, samples and runs are provided as download option.
