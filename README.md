## Description

Parkour LIMS (Laboratory Information Management System) is a software package for sample processing and quality management of next-generation sequencing (NGS) data and samples. Besides extensive functionality, most of existing LIMS are missing electronic laboratory notebook aspects to support, organize, and ultimately standardize initial laboratory-intensive sample preparation steps. The LIMS was designed to coordinate laboratory work by clearly structuring tasks and facilitate high-quality sample preparation. Deep sequencing users, laboratory personnel, and data managers will benefit from using Parkour LIMS as a central laboratory and quality management platform.

## Main Features

- Online sequencing request submission
