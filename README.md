Parkour LIMS aims to help laboratories, dealing with thousands of samples per year, with laboratory management, documentation, tracking, and evaluation. To do this, the LIMS has a web-based interface, which means anyone who has rights to access it can create new requests for Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) without asking the lab staff to do so and watch the request processing status in real time. The scalable and flexible structure of the LIMS can also allow the request of a primary analysis for sequences of a respective request in the future. The LIMS's general principles are a simple yet functional web interface, ease of use, user input validation, and fast data processing. Most importantly, Parkour LIMS also automates many repetitive tasks and simplifies critical work of staff in the lab.
